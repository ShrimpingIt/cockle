# National Curriculum

## Key stage 3

Pupils should be taught to:
* design, use and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and
behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems
* understand several key algorithms that reflect computational thinking [for example,
ones for sorting and searching]; use logical reasoning to compare the utility of
alternative algorithms for the same problem
* use two or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a
variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures [for
example, lists, tables or arrays]; design and develop modular programs that use
procedures or functions
* understand simple Boolean logic [for example, AND, OR and NOT] and some of its
uses in circuits and programming; understand how numbers can be represented in
binary, and be able to carry out simple operations on binary numbers [for example,
binary addition, and conversion between binary and decimal]
* understand the hardware and software components that make up computer systems,
and how they communicate with one another and with other systems
* understand how instructions are stored and executed within a computer system;
understand how data of various types (including text, sounds and pictures) can be
represented and manipulated digitally, in the form of binary digits
* undertake creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple
applications, preferably across a range of devices, to achieve challenging goals,
including collecting and analysing data and meeting the needs of known users
* create, re-use, revise and re-purpose digital artefacts for a given audience, with
attention to trustworthiness, design and usability
* understand a range of ways to use technology safely, respectfully, responsibly and
securely, including protecting their online identity and privacy; recognise inappropriate
content, contact and conduct and know how to report concerns.
